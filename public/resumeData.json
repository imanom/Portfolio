    "bio":"A master's in Computer Engineering student at Virginia Tech, I am a technology enthusiast. I strongly believe in the language-agnostic approach and am ready to develop solutions in newer and efficient technologies. \n Currently, as a part of my master's journey, I am delving deep into computer systems and systems programming - exploring the LLVM compiler and the Linux kernel. System software excites me because this is the niche where you develop low-level technologies which will be used by developers and users alike - for example, improving the functionality of file management systems or operating systems. \n I moved to the States in Jan'21 from Assam, which is a state in the north-east part of India and is renowned for its tea. In my spare time I can be usually found with my nose buried inside a book or my kindle - I love to read! I have over the past two years tried to maintain a list of the books that I have been reading and they can be viewed on my Goodreads linked in my socials.\n I strive to constantly improve and push myself out of the comfort zone. I have taken up French classes, gotten pretty good at strumming my guitar, cooking new dishes, broadening my low-level C implementation skills - all taken up to immerse myself in new challenges. \nPlease feel free to reach out to me using my email-id listed below or any of the linked social sites!",
