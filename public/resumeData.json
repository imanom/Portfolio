    "bio":"A master's in Computer Engineering student at Virginia Tech, I am a technology enthusiast. I strongly believe in the language-agnostic approach and am ready to develop solutions in newer and efficient technologies. \n Currently, as a part of my master's journey, I am delving deep into system software, (the interface in between hardware and software) - exploring the LLVM compiler, the Linux kernel, multithreading, computer architecture. \n I moved to the United States in Jan'21 from Assam, which is a state in the north-east part of India and is renowned for its tea. In my spare time I can be usually found with my nose buried inside a book or my kindle - I love to read! I have over the past two years tried to maintain a list of the books that I have been reading and they can be viewed on my Goodreads linked in my socials. \n\nPlease feel free to reach out to me using my email-id listed below or any of the linked social sites!",
