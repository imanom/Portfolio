    "bio":"A master's in Computer Engineering student at Virginia Tech, I am a technology enthusiast. I strongly believe in the language-agnostic approach and am ready to develop solutions in newer and efficient technologies. \nCurrently, as a part of my master's journey, I am delving deep into computer systems and systems programming - exploring the LLVM compiler and the Linux kernel.\n Having 3+ years of work experience in web/app development, I am proficient in backend development using Node.js, with a knack for frontend development using React. Being involved in projects delivering end to end B2X solutions to customers, I believe in the importance of creating modular, clean, and testable code and can vouch for the efficiency of the Agile methodology. \nPlease feel free to reach out to me using my email-id listed below or any of the linked social sites!",
